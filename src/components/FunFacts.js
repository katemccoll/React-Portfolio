                    Best known for always having a smile on my face and a bubbly personality to match.
                    I always try to find the fun in what in what I do as I believe that is when I produce my best work.
                    I love to learn!

                    I have been drawn to art from a young age, always interested in emotion and
                    fine detail that painting can bring. I love experiment with my art and my subject matters, from
                    people to abstract art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I still paint and draw, I am now experimenting with digital art.
