                    Hello! I am Kate, a Kiwi that is currently living over in Melbourne. Since completing my Fine Arts
                    degree at
                    the University of Canterbury in 2016, I have been working in an Australian art and gift shop.
                    While I enjoy the personal aspect of my job, it drains a lot of my artistic ambition, so when I come
                    home I
                    often want to get away from art.
                    A career as a web developer would be great because I'd be able to focus on solving interesting
                    problems
                    during the day, while still having the energy and desire to create my art outside of work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along with being creative, I am bubbly and known to always have a big smile on my face. I am
                    dedicated
                    and
                    love looking at all the fine details, especially when it comes to puzzles and drawing realistic
                    portraits.
                    I love getting fully invested in something that I'm passionate about, and I find it incredibly
                    rewarding
                    when the hard work pays off.

                </p>

                    I am currently enrolled at Monash University Coding Bootcamp, very intense and fast pace but enjoy
                    learning and thinking about websites in a different way. I have really enjoyed creating websites
                    from
                    scratch and looking for the small details to make the page better.
                    I love that I can bring my creative side to each of my assignments and using my knowledge to build a
                    site
                    like a jigsaw puzzle. I hope by the end of this course, I will have the confidence to build and
                    create
                    innovate websites and bring my art skills into the digital art world.
